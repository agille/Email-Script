# Pineapple Email Script
This repository contains the email script created to expedite the process of sending agents their residual files monthly as well as examples of the text and csv files required to be read into the script. 
This allowed members of the team to save time each month that would've had to be spent manually sending large amounts of emails.
This script was created primarily using yagmail, a GMAIL/SMTP client used to simplify the process of sending emails.
